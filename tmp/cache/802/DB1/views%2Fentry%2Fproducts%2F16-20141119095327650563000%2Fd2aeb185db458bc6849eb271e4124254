                 <h3>Web Design for Developers</h3>
                 <p>
        <em>Web Design for Developers</em> will show you how to make your
        web-based application look professionally designed. We'll help you
        learn how to pick the right colors and fonts, avoid costly interface
        and accessibility mistakes -- your application will really come alive.
        We'll also walk you through some common Photoshop and CSS techniques
        and work through a web site redesign, taking a new design from concept
        all the way to implementation.
